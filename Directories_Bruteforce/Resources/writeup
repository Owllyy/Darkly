By bruteforcing directories with a wordlist i have found /admin and /whatever.

At /whatever there was a file "htpasswd" containing a combined list username:password of size one.
At /admin there was a login form for admin.
Next step was to decode the flag with MD5 decode algorithm to find "qwerty123@" and connect to /admin.

Solution: 
	- Rename all your directories with different name that default
	- Choose a better encoding algorithm like sha256
	- Don't allow directorie search //TODO
	- Choose better password (longer at least)
