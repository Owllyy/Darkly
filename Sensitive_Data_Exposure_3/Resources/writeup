Bruteforcing directories with a wordlist revealed an /admin path.

At /whatever (Sensitive Data Exposure on robots.txt) there was a file "htpasswd" containing a combined username:password list of size one.
Using a wordlist dictionary.txt at root directories revealed the /admin page where there was a login form.
The next step was to decode the flag with an MD5 decode algorithm to find "qwerty123@" and connect to /admin.

Vulnerability:
Sensitive Data Exposure is the accidental release of sensitive information (like personal information, login credentials, confidential business inforation..).

Danger:
Depends on the nature of the leaked data.

Solutions:
	- rename all your directories and config file with different names than default ones
	- choose a better encoding algorithm like sha256 for password
	- choose better passwords (longer at least)
	- don't store sensitive data on accessable paths
