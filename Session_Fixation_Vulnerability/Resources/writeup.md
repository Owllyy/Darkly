When accessing the website we can see that a cookie is generated containing key named 'I_am_admin' with a value of '68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327'.

The value is actually a MD5 hash standing for 'false'. Getting a new MD5 hash for the value 'true' and changing the value of the cookie triggers a flag to be revealed when accessing the website.

Dangers: this vulnerability allows to impersonate other users or administrators.

Possible fix solution: do not keep such information in a cookie.
